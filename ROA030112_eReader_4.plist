Today, America needs fresh leadership to lead us as a nation out of this economic crisis. Leadership must come not only from our political leaders but also from the average citizen. The exporting of American jobs is a trend that must be stopped and reversed. When I walk into my local hardware store, I typically find 85% of the goods for sale are manufactured 7,000 miles away. Recognizable American brands have been forced by shortsighted management and buyers at large national chains to build factories overseas just to save a lousy $.50 on a tape measure. To these ruthless buyers, it is all about the money. Rarely are product quality, the political system, human rights, animal rights and environmental costs to the planet considered, not to mention the cost to our society of exporting not only jobs, but an entire factory! At MacNeil Automotive, we are doing our part for the American economy and for our 300 million fellow citizens and neighbors. My philosophy is that if my neighbor doesn‚Äôt have a job, sooner or later I won‚Äôt have a job either. For example, we used to have our All-Weather Floor Mats manufactured in England by a company that used antiquated, inefficient  equipment. They made a decent floor mat for us, but we thought we could build a better floor mat for our customers using modern American technology, American raw materials and skilled American workers. So in 2007 we transferred all of our floor mat manufac- turing back to the United States. Today, we build the best fitting, highest quality automotive floor mats in the world, right here in America. Our machine shop is equipped with 17 CNC machining centers including four 4 axis mills and one 5 axis mill that produce between 30 to 50 injection and thermoforming molds per month. We have one shift of highly skilled American Journeymen toolmakers and apprentices, but our machines run 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. There is not a more efficient tool and mold making operation in the world - and guess what, it‚Äôs right here in America. ¬©2011 by MacNeil IP LLC</string>    <key>views</key>    <array>      <dict>        <key>view-type</key>        <string>link</string>        <key>final-coordinates</key>        <string/>        <key>page-number</key>        <integer>4</integer>      </dict>    </array>  </dict></plist>
